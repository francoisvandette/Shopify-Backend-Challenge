- localbase library returns arrays and seems to be very straighforward.
	- I think I can return the Inventory table, return the warehouse table, and just make a new array with the info I need to do a mock JOIN
	
ORDER OF THINGS TO DO THEM IN
1) Warehouse Page CRUD
2) Inventory Page render and allow for assigning stock

- main page, 
	- could add a checkbox option to allow for assigning inventory to already made warehouses?
		- checkbox makes a div visible, a dropdown to select the warehouse, and input for assigning quantity
		- button to add another warehouse location with quantity
			- button to remove that warehouse option

- for warehouses, I think just having a page for adding and editing 
	
- inventory idea 2
	- user clicks a product specific "Inventory" button on the main page...
	- generates a table with all the warehouses
	- for each warehouse, displays the quantities
		- there is an input to add or subtract the quantities
		- individual save buttons
		- master save button
