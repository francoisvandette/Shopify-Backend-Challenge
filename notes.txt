- localbase library returns arrays and seems to be very straighforward.
	- I think I can return the Inventory table, return the warehouse table, and just make a new array with the info I need to do a mock JOIN
	
for(let i = 0; i < productTable1.length; i++) {
	if (productTable1[i].ProductName == `crap`) {
		array1.push(productTable1[i]);
	}
}


- for warehouses, I think just having a page for adding and editing 

- inventory
	- product code dropdown, generated 
	- warehouse dropdown, generated
	- input for quantity, maybe with arrows up and down?, loaded from db
